## Overview

Control Assurance in Risk Legion provides a framework for evaluating the design and operational effectiveness of controls that mitigate business risks. The framework uses a dual assessment approach: **Test of Design (ToD)** and **Test of Effectiveness (ToE)**.

## Control Hierarchy

Risk Legion organizes controls in a two-level hierarchy:

```
Key Control (Parent)
├── Sub-Control 1
├── Sub-Control 2
└── Sub-Control 3
```

### Key Controls

Key Controls are high-level control categories that represent major control themes:

- **Preventive Controls** - Stop risks from occurring
- **Detective Controls** - Identify risks that have occurred
- **Corrective Controls** - Remediate identified issues

Examples:
- Automated Credit Scoring and Risk Rating
- Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)
- Real-Time AML Transaction Monitoring
- Asset-Liability Committee (ALCO)

### Sub-Controls

Sub-Controls are specific control instances under each Key Control:

- Represent individual control activities
- Have their own ToD and ToE assessments
- Link directly to risk scenarios in BRAs

Examples under "Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)":
- Biometric Authentication Enrollment
- Failed Authentication Lockout
- Session Timeout Policy

## Test of Design (ToD)

Test of Design evaluates **how well a control is designed** to mitigate the identified risk.

### ToD Rating Scale

| Grade | Rating | Description |
|-------|--------|-------------|
| **A** | Excellent | Control design is comprehensive, automated, and addresses all aspects of the risk |
| **B** | Good | Control design is well-structured with minor gaps that don't significantly impact effectiveness |
| **C** | Adequate | Control design meets minimum requirements but has noticeable gaps |
| **D** | Weak | Control design has significant gaps that may allow risk to materialize |
| **E** | Inadequate | Control design is fundamentally flawed or non-existent |

### ToD Assessment Criteria

When assessing ToD, consider:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Documentation" icon="file-lines">
    Are control procedures documented?
    - Policy documents exist
    - Procedures are current
    - Responsibilities are clear
  </Card>
  <Card title="Coverage" icon="shield">
    Does the control address the full risk?
    - All risk scenarios covered
    - No significant gaps
    - Edge cases considered
  </Card>
  <Card title="Automation" icon="robot">
    Is the control automated where appropriate?
    - Manual vs. automated balance
    - Consistent execution
    - Scalable design
  </Card>
  <Card title="Integration" icon="puzzle-piece">
    Does the control fit the process?
    - Integrated into workflows
    - Not easily bypassed
    - Sustainable long-term
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Test of Effectiveness (ToE)

Test of Effectiveness evaluates **how well the control operates in practice**.

### ToE Rating Scale

| Grade | Rating | Description |
|-------|--------|-------------|
| **1** | Highly Effective | Control operates consistently and catches/prevents 95%+ of relevant issues |
| **2** | Effective | Control operates reliably with occasional minor exceptions (85-95%) |
| **3** | Moderately Effective | Control operates adequately but with regular exceptions (70-85%) |
| **4** | Less Effective | Control has significant operational gaps (50-70%) |
| **5** | Ineffective | Control fails to operate as designed (&lt;50%) |

### ToE Assessment Methods

| Method | Description | When to Use |
|--------|-------------|-------------|
| **Sample Testing** | Test a sample of transactions/activities | High-volume automated controls |
| **Walkthrough** | Observe control in operation | Manual controls, processes |
| **Inquiry** | Interview control operators | Understanding procedures |
| **Inspection** | Review documentation/evidence | Periodic reviews, approvals |
| **Re-performance** | Re-execute the control | Critical calculations |

## Total Effectiveness Calculation

Risk Legion automatically calculates **Total Effectiveness** from the ToD and ToE ratings:

```
Total Effectiveness = f(ToD, ToE)
```

### Effectiveness Matrix

|  | ToE 1 | ToE 2 | ToE 3 | ToE 4 | ToE 5 |
|--|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|
| **ToD A** | Highly Effective | Highly Effective | Effective | Moderately Effective | Less Effective |
| **ToD B** | Highly Effective | Effective | Effective | Moderately Effective | Less Effective |
| **ToD C** | Effective | Effective | Moderately Effective | Less Effective | Not Effective |
| **ToD D** | Moderately Effective | Moderately Effective | Less Effective | Not Effective | Not Effective |
| **ToD E** | Less Effective | Less Effective | Not Effective | Not Effective | Not Effective |

<Note>
The matrix uses a conservative approach: both design AND effectiveness must be strong for a control to be rated highly effective.
</Note>

## Control Assurance Workflow

### Step 1: Identify Controls

During BRA creation, controls are linked to risk scenarios:

1. System suggests controls from the Risk Library
2. Assessor reviews and confirms relevant controls
3. Additional controls can be added as needed

### Step 2: Assess Test of Design

For each sub-control:

1. Review control documentation
2. Evaluate design against risk
3. Assign ToD rating (A-E)
4. Provide justification

```json
{
  "sub_control_id": "sc-001",
  "tod": "B",
  "tod_justification": "MFA design is comprehensive with biometric and OTP options. Minor gap: legacy systems not yet integrated."
}
```

### Step 3: Assess Test of Effectiveness

For each sub-control:

1. Select testing method
2. Execute testing procedure
3. Document testing date and tester
4. Assign ToE rating (1-5)
5. Provide justification and evidence notes

```json
{
  "sub_control_id": "sc-001",
  "toe": "2",
  "toe_justification": "Sample testing of 100 transactions showed 93% MFA compliance. 7% exceptions were authorized by security team.",
  "testing_date": "2026-01-15",
  "tested_by": "Jane Smith",
  "evidence_notes": "Sample report attached, exception log reviewed"
}
```

### Step 4: Review and Update

Controls should be reassessed:
- At each BRA assessment period
- After significant control changes
- Following control failures or incidents
- When new risks are identified

## Control Heat Map

The Control Heat Map visualizes control effectiveness across your organization:

### Dashboard View

The dashboard displays:
- **ToD vs ToE Matrix** - Distribution of controls by ratings
- **Effectiveness Summary** - Counts by effectiveness level
- **Trend Indicators** - Changes from previous period

### Interpreting the Heat Map

<Steps>
  <Step title="Identify Clusters">
    Look for concentrations of controls in specific cells
  </Step>
  <Step title="Assess Risk Areas">
    Controls in bottom-right (D/E + 4/5) need immediate attention
  </Step>
  <Step title="Track Improvements">
    Monitor movement toward top-left over time
  </Step>
  <Step title="Plan Remediation">
    Prioritize controls with high residual risk scenarios
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Key Control Effectiveness Aggregation

Key Control effectiveness is aggregated from its Sub-Controls using a **worst-case approach**:

```python
def aggregate_key_control_effectiveness(sub_controls):
    # If any sub-control is "Not Effective", key control is "Not Effective"
    if any(sc.total_effectiveness == "Not Effective" for sc in sub_controls):
        return "Not Effective"
    
    # If any sub-control is "Less Effective", key control is "Less Effective"
    if any(sc.total_effectiveness == "Less Effective" for sc in sub_controls):
        return "Less Effective"
    
    # Continue up the scale...
```

<Warning>
This conservative approach ensures that weaknesses in individual sub-controls are not masked by stronger controls.
</Warning>

## Control Library Management

### Adding Controls

Client Admins can add custom controls:

1. Navigate to **Governance → Risk Library → Key Controls**
2. Click **Add Key Control**
3. Enter control details (name, category, description)
4. Add Sub-Controls under the Key Control

### Linking Controls to Scenarios

Controls can be linked to risk scenarios:

1. Navigate to **Governance → Risk Library → Risk Scenarios**
2. Select a scenario
3. Click **Link Controls**
4. Select relevant Key Controls and Sub-Controls

### Archiving Controls

Controls can be archived (soft delete):

1. Click the archive icon on the control
2. Confirm archiving
3. Archived controls remain in historical BRAs
4. Can be restored if needed

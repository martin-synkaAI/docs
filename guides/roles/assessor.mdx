## Overview

Assessors are the primary users who create and conduct Business Risk Assessments. They identify risks, rate impact and likelihood, link controls, and prepare assessments for approval.

## Key Responsibilities

| Responsibility | Description |
|---------------|-------------|
| BRA Creation | Create new Business Risk Assessments |
| Risk Assessment | Rate inherent and residual risks |
| Control Linking | Link relevant controls to risk scenarios |
| Control Assessment | Rate Test of Design and Test of Effectiveness |
| Justification | Document rationale for all ratings |
| Submission | Submit completed BRAs for approval |
| Action Management | Create and manage mitigation actions |

## Access Scope

### Entity-Based Access

Assessors are assigned to specific Legal Entities and/or Business Units:

```
Assessor: John Smith
├── Assigned: ACME Bank Brasil S.A.
│   ├── Retail Banking
│   └── Digital Channels
└── NOT Assigned: ACME Seguros Ltda.
```

<Info>
Assessors can only see and work with data from their assigned entities. This ensures data segregation within large organizations.
</Info>

### Permissions

| Feature | Permission |
|---------|------------|
| Dashboard | View (filtered to assigned entities) |
| BRAs | Create, Edit, Submit |
| Risk Scenarios | View, Include in BRAs |
| Controls | View, Link to scenarios, Assess ToD/ToE |
| Mitigation Actions | Create, Edit, Update status |
| Risk Library | View only |
| Governance | View only |
| Users | No access |

## Assessor Workflows

### Creating a BRA

<Steps>
  <Step title="Initialize">
    Navigate to **BRAs → Create New BRA**
    - Select Legal Entity (from assigned entities)
    - Select Business Unit
    - Enter assessment period and details
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Select Scenarios">
    Choose risk scenarios relevant to the assessment
    - Browse by category
    - Filter by product linkage
    - Include/exclude as appropriate
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Rate Inherent Risk">
    For each scenario, assess inherent risk:
    - Rate Impact (1-5)
    - Rate Likelihood (1-5)
    - Provide justification
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Link Controls">
    Associate controls with each scenario:
    - Select Key Controls
    - Select Sub-Controls
    - System suggests linked controls
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Assess Controls">
    For each linked control:
    - Rate Test of Design (A-E)
    - Rate Test of Effectiveness (1-5)
    - Document evidence and testing details
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Rate Residual Risk">
    After considering controls:
    - Rate residual Impact (1-5)
    - Rate residual Likelihood (1-5)
    - Explain how controls mitigate risk
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Review and Submit">
    Final review:
    - Check all scenarios rated
    - Verify control linkages
    - Submit for approval
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Conducting Risk Assessments

#### Inherent Risk Rating

Consider risk **before** any controls:

| Question | Consideration |
|----------|---------------|
| What is the worst-case impact? | Financial loss, regulatory penalty, reputation damage |
| How likely is this scenario? | Historical data, industry benchmarks, expert judgment |
| What evidence supports this rating? | Past incidents, audit findings, external reports |

**Documentation Requirements:**
- Clear justification for both Impact and Likelihood
- Reference to supporting evidence
- Explanation of key assumptions

#### Control Assessment

For each linked control, assess effectiveness:

**Test of Design (ToD):**
- Is the control properly documented?
- Does it address the risk adequately?
- Is it integrated into processes?

**Test of Effectiveness (ToE):**
- How was the control tested?
- What were the test results?
- What exceptions were identified?

<Tip>
Document testing date, tester name, and evidence notes for audit purposes.
</Tip>

#### Residual Risk Rating

After considering controls:

| Scenario | Guidance |
|----------|----------|
| Controls highly effective | Residual should be significantly lower than inherent |
| Controls moderately effective | Residual should be lower than inherent |
| Controls ineffective | Residual may equal inherent risk |
| No controls linked | Residual equals inherent risk |

### Working with Action Plans

Assessors can manage mitigation actions:

#### Creating Actions

From the BRA workspace or Action Plans page:
1. Click **Create Action**
2. Enter action details
3. Assign owner and due date
4. Set priority
5. Link to BRA/scenario if applicable

#### Updating Actions

- Update status as work progresses
- Modify due dates when needed
- Add notes on progress
- Close when complete

<Note>
Actions linked to approved BRAs remain active and should be tracked to completion.
</Note>

## Dashboard View

Assessors see a filtered dashboard:

### Visible Data
- Risk metrics for assigned entities only
- BRAs they created or can access
- Actions they own or for their entities
- Control effectiveness for their scope

### Not Visible
- Data from unassigned entities
- Enterprise-wide aggregates
- User management
- Risk appetite configuration

## Collaboration

### Working with Client Admins

- Client Admins approve submitted BRAs
- May request changes with comments
- Provide guidance on risk appetite
- Can reassign entity access

### Working with Reviewers

- Reviewers can view your assessments
- May provide feedback informally
- Cannot modify your work
- Can access audit trails

## Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Preparation">
    Before starting a BRA:
    - Gather relevant data and reports
    - Review previous assessments
    - Understand current control status
    - Consult with business stakeholders
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Consistency">
    Maintain rating consistency:
    - Use organizational rating guidelines
    - Reference calibration examples
    - Apply same criteria across scenarios
    - Document assumptions clearly
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Evidence">
    Support ratings with evidence:
    - Reference specific documents
    - Cite incident data
    - Include testing results
    - Maintain audit trail
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Timeliness">
    Complete assessments on schedule:
    - Start early in the period
    - Track progress regularly
    - Submit before deadlines
    - Respond promptly to feedback
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Common Scenarios

### BRA Returned for Changes

If Client Admin requests changes:

1. Review feedback comments
2. Navigate to the BRA
3. Make requested updates
4. Re-submit for approval
5. Address any follow-up comments

### Mid-Assessment Changes

If business circumstances change during assessment:

1. Update risk ratings as appropriate
2. Document the change in justification
3. Consider adding relevant scenarios
4. Update control assessments if needed

### Creating Follow-Up Actions

When risks exceed appetite:

1. Create mitigation actions
2. Link to specific risk scenario
3. Set appropriate priority
4. Assign realistic due dates
5. Track progress to completion

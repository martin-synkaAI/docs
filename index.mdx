## Core Concepts

### Business Risk Assessment (BRA)

A BRA is a structured assessment that identifies and evaluates business risks across multiple categories:

- **Strategic Risks**: Market competition, mergers & acquisitions
- **Operational Risks**: Business continuity, supply chain
- **Financial Risks**: Fraud, cash flow, budget management
- **Compliance Risks**: Regulatory compliance, data privacy
- **Technology Risks**: Cybersecurity, system availability
- **Reputational Risks**: Brand damage, customer trust

Each risk is assessed for:
- **Impact**: Severity of consequences (1-5 scale)
- **Likelihood**: Probability of occurrence (1-5 scale)
- **Inherent Risk**: Risk level without controls
- **Residual Risk**: Risk level after control application

### Control Effectiveness

Controls are evaluated using two dimensions:

1. **Test of Design (ToD)**: How well the control is designed
   - Optimized, Defined, Ad-Hoc, Not Documented

2. **Test of Effectiveness (ToE)**: How well the control operates
   - Always Effective, Usually Effective, Sometimes Effective, Rarely Effective, Not Tested

Combined scoring produces overall effectiveness:
- **Strong** (90-100): Optimal design and execution
- **Effective** (70-89): Well-designed and mostly effective
- **Moderate** (50-69): Adequate but room for improvement
- **Weak** (30-49): Significant gaps in design or execution
- **Failing** (0-29): Critical deficiencies

## User Workflows

### Assessor Workflow
1. Create new BRA
2. Identify and categorize risks
3. Assess impact and likelihood
4. Map controls to risks
5. Submit for review

### Reviewer Workflow
1. Review submitted BRAs
2. Validate risk assessments
3. Request changes if needed
4. Approve final assessment

### Client Admin Workflow
1. Manage enterprise users
2. Configure risk appetite
3. Create custom controls
4. Monitor action plans
5. View enterprise dashboards

### Super Admin Workflow
1. Manage all enterprises
2. Monitor enterprise health
3. Handle alerts (churn risk, adoption gaps)
4. Track platform metrics
5. Manage super admin users
